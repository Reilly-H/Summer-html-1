            <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
            <h3>We lost everything</h3>
            <h3>we had to pay the price</h3>
            <h3>yeah we lost everything</h3>
            <h3>we had to pay the price,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>I saw in you what life was missing</h3>
            <h3>you lit a flame that consumed my hate</h3>
            <h3>I'm not one for reminiscing but</h3>
            <h3>I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>Yeah</h3>
            <h3>cause we lost everything</h3>
            <h3>we had to pay the price,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>There's a canvas with two faces</h3>
            <h3>of fallen angels who loved and lost</h3>
            <h3>it was a passion for the ages</h3>
            <h3>and in the end guess we paid the cost,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>A thing of beauty - i know</h3>
            <h3>will never fade away</h3>
            <h3>what you did to me - i know</h3>
            <h3>said what you had to say</h3>
            <h3>but a thing of beauty,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>Will never fade away</h3>
            <h3>will never fade away</h3>
            <h3>will never fade away,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>I see your eyes, i know you see me</h3>
            <h3>you're like a ghost how you're everywhere</h3>
            <h3>I am your demon never leaving</h3>
            <h3>a metal soul of rage and fear,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>That one thing that changed it all</h3>
            <h3>that one sin that caused the fall,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>A thing of beauty - I know</h3>
            <h3>will never fade away</h3>
            <h3>what you did to me - I know</h3>
            <h3>said what you had to say</h3>
            <h3>but a thing of beauty - I know</h3>
            <h3>will never fade away</h3>
            <h3>and I'll do my duty - I know</h3>
            <h3>somehow I'll find a way</h3>
            <h3>but a thing of beauty</h3>
            <h3>will never fade away</h3>
            <h3>and I'll do my duty,</h3>
            <h3>------------------------</h3>
            <h3>Yeah</h3>
            <h3>we'll never fade away</h3>
